## 2026-01-16: Set up Go project with basic HTTP server

### Completed
- Created go.mod with module github.com/ralphy/taskserver (Go 1.21)
- Created main.go with:
  - Task struct with ID, Title, Description, Completed, and CreatedAt fields
  - TaskStore for thread-safe in-memory storage using sync.RWMutex
  - Server struct with HTTP handlers for all CRUD operations
  - Routes: GET/POST /tasks and GET/DELETE /tasks/{id}
  - Proper Content-Type headers (application/json)
  - Appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 204, 400, 404, 405, 500)
- Created main_test.go with comprehensive tests:
  - TaskStore unit tests (Create, Get, GetAll, Delete)
  - Server integration tests for all endpoints
  - Error handling tests (invalid JSON, missing title, 404s, method not allowed)

### Test Results
All 18 tests passing.

## 2026-01-16: Mark GET /tasks endpoint as complete

### Completed
- Verified GET /tasks endpoint implementation in main.go (listTasks method)
- Endpoint returns all tasks as JSON array with Content-Type: application/json
- Returns empty array [] when no tasks exist
- Confirmed existing tests cover this endpoint (TestServerBasic)
- All 18 tests passing
- Linting passes (go vet, gofmt)
- Marked task as complete in PRD.md
